loadtest-preload.sh is a shell script that populates a PowerSteering server's cache in preparation for a load test.  The cache must be populated so the load test simulates a live site;  an empty cache means an unusually slow server.

The script uses the UNIX 'wget' utility.  wget takes a URL as its parameter and fetches that URL from the web.  loadtest-preload.sh passes two additional parameters to wget:  "--spider" and "--load-cookies=cookies.txt".  The "--spider" parameter tells wget not to download anything (usually wget saves a local copy of the URL).  The "--load-cookies=cookies.txt" provides a cookies file that will allow the script to log in to the server.  The directory from which loadtest-preload.sh is being run must contain a valid cookies.txt file, or the script won't work.

The cookies.txt file is server- and context-specific; each context has its own unique login cookie.  A cookies.txt file for the Raytheon context on QAAPP is provided.

To make a new cookies.txt, do this:

* Open a web browser.
* Log in to the context to be tested, selecting 'Year' as the time period.
* Close all browser windows.
* Locate the browser's stored cookies.  Internet Explorer's cookies can generally be found in:
    C:\Documents And Settings\<username>\Cookies
  with one file for each cookie, where <username> is the logged-in users' login name.
  Mozilla's cookies are found in:
    C:\Documents And Settings\<username>\Application Data\Mozilla\Profiles\default\<unique id>\cookies.txt
  with one file for *all* cookies.  The <unique id> changes, but there should be only one of them in the default\
  directory.  Alternatively, Mozilla users can just use Start->Search->Files and Folders to search for files called
  cookies.txt.
* If using Internet Explorer, find the cookies file corresponding to the server to be tested.  Copy this file to the
  loadtest-preload.sh directory and name it cookies.txt
* If using Mozilla, copy cookies.txt to the loadtest-preload.sh directory and edit out all cookies except the login
  cookie for the server to be tested.  (Merrily ignore the 'do not edit' warning in the cookies file.)

The script itself is also server- and context-specific - the version in CVS points to the Raytheon context on QAAPP.  To adapt the script to a new server, use a text editor's search-and-replace feature to replace all occurrences of http://qaapp.cinteractive.com/raytheon/ with http://yourserver.cinteractive.com/yourcontext/.  The URLs in the script refer to Raytheon's database, so if you're using a different database you'll have to come up with a whole new set of URLs.

When cookies.txt is in place, the script can be run either from a UNIX-based machine that has the wget utility (basically any of our Linux or FreeBSD servers), or from the Cygwin package on Windows.  Cygwin emulates a UNIX shell within Windows, and comes with the wget utility.  It can be downloaded from http://www.cygwin.com/.
